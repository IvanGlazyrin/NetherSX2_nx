<h1 align=center>NetherSX2 · Switch Port</h1>

A wrapper/port of NetherSX2 to the Nintendo Switch.
It loads the original Android emulator core `libemucore.so`, 
patches it, and runs it inside a minimal Android-like
environment natively.

Everything ships as a **single `NetherSX2.nro`**: it bundles both emulator cores
(Patched `4248` + Classic `3668`), three renderer backends (native Deko3D, OpenGL, Vulkan/NVK)
and each build's data files, and extracts the ones you pick to the SD card at
launch. An SDL cover-art launcher chooses the game, the renderer, and per-game
settings, then chainloads the emulator.

The launcher supports multiple library folders across SD, USB mass storage
(FAT32, exFAT, NTFS), and SMB shares.

**L + R + Plus** to open the quick menu for save states, controller rebinding,
selectable per-game PNACH cheat codes, RetroAchievements progress,
frame-limiter control, reset, and exit.
The cheat browser reads `/switch/nethersx2/cheats/<CRC>.pnach`, recognizes PNACH
`[sections]` and legacy `// code name` blocks.

No emulator core, BIOS, or game assets are included in this repository.

### How to install

1. Copy `NetherSX2.nro` into `/switch/` on your SD card.
2. Put your own PS2 BIOS dump into `/switch/nethersx2/bios/`.

The launcher creates the rest of the folder tree on first run:

```
/switch/NetherSX2.nro
/switch/nethersx2/
  .emu/         <- extracted when selected
  bios/         <- your PS2 BIOS dump           (you supply)
  resources/    <- shaders / GameIndex / fonts  (auto-extracted per core)
  covers/       <- cover art (<game-key>.png)
  gamecfg/      <- per-game launcher settings
  lsfg/         <- optional user-supplied Lossless.dll
  forwarders/   <- HOME shortcut launch records
  hidden.ini    <- hidden library entries
  launcher.ini  <- the launcher's saved config
```

### Notes

This will not run in applet/album mode — it needs the full memory of a game
override. Launch it by holding **R** while opening an installed title, or use a
forwarder.

A PS2 BIOS dump is required and must come from your own console; the launcher
warns at startup when `bios/` is empty.

Casual RetroAchievements are available from **Settings > RetroAchievements**.
Sign in once in the launcher, then enable achievements before starting a game.
Successful sign-in stores the returned account token in `launcher.ini`.
Achievement progress and descriptions can be viewed during play from
**L + R + Plus > Achievements**.

Select **Settings > Graphics > Renderer > Deko3D (Native)** to use the native GS
backend. It replaces the core's GPU device and display callbacks with Deko3D
commands. The Deko emulator NRO is linked separately, without EGL, GLES, Vulkan,
NVK, or Gallium driver archives. The SDL launcher uses its own graphics runtime
and exits before the emulator starts.

LSFG 2x Frame Generation is available for Vulkan and Deko3D in
**Settings > Frame Generation**.
You must provide your own `Lossless.dll` at `/switch/nethersx2/lsfg/Lossless.dll`.
LSFG must be enabled before launching a game so its shader session can be
prepared. Frame Generation starts **Off** in every game and must be enabled
manually from **L + R + Plus > Frame Generation**. Skip Duplicate Frames is
automatically enabled for prepared LSFG sessions so only unique game frames
are interpolated.

### How to build

Install the devkitPro Switch toolchain and portlibs:

```sh
pacman -S devkitA64 switch-tools libnx switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_ttf \
          switch-sdl2_image switch-curl switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau \
          switch-ntfs-3g switch-libpng deko3d
```

Provide a compatible Mesa NVK package under `vulkan/include` and `vulkan/lib`.
Extract the 4248 and 3668 APKs into sibling folders named
`NetherSX2-v2.2n-4248` and `NetherSX2-v2.2n-3668`, or set `CORES_DIR` to the
folder containing them. Alternatively, extract the supplied inputs without
installing the Mesa SDK into the toolchain:

```sh
python3 tools/prepare_build_inputs.py --apk-4248 /path/to/NetherSX2-v2.2n-4248.apk \
  --apk-3668 /path/to/NetherSX2-v2.2n-3668.apk --mesa-sdk /path/to/mesa-sdk.zip
export MESA_SDK_ROOT="$PWD/out/mesa-sdk"
```

CMake, Ninja, Git, Bison, Flex, Python, and Python Mako are required. The build
downloads pinned libsmb2, libusbhsfs, UAM and SPIRV-Cross revisions. Deko3D is
built as an independent emulator NRO and bundled alongside the existing backends.

```sh
./build_all.sh
```
